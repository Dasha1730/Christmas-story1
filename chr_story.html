	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%"> Everyone has favorite place. It can be park or library or something else. Emily has a place like this too. It was a small café near her home. She has been going there every weak for 3 years. </h3>

	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%"> Today she went there too. She sat on her favorite place. Ordered cocoa with marshmallows and wanted to start a new book. It was Christmas book, by the way today was 23 of December. Emily was ready to start, but she heard that the ball near the door rang. She raised her eyes and saw an old man coming into the café. He was in an old coat; his face was red because of the cold. And his eyes were shone with some distant joy. Girl’s imagination starts to draw in her head. Unconsciously Emily started to create his history and the reason he came into this café. </h3>
	
	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%"> Karl was going down the street. He was really upset and a little bit angry. I’m not going to tell you way, but you should know that he had a disgusting day. He was going at home after a night shift. At one moment he saw children playing in snow. He remembered about his own daughter, she prefers party in college, and in this year, they couldn’t be together on Christmas. Karl becomes more and more upset. He heard kids’ laughing and started to recall all his memories with daughter. He became more pleasure. Then he saw a café, and pictures in his head…</h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%">-Your cocoa with marshmallows. – the waiter said. He puts the cup on Emily’s table. Emily clicked her tongue in annoyance, now the thought was lost. </h3>
	
	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%">-Am I wrong? You ordered something else...? Sorry, I’m new hear…- the waiter seems really upset.</h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%">-Oh, now it’s exactly what I have ordered. Thank you. – Emily smile. – By the way, what your name? I’m a regular customer and know everyone’s names hear, so...</h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%">-Ah, I see. I am Mark, an you must be Emily, Jhon told me about you. Nice to meet you!</h3>
	
	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%">They talk just for 10 minutes and then Mark was called. Emily looked at the door and in the next moment it opens. Little girl, she was only 10, come in. </h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%">Emily was looking at the girl, and she could see how the girl start talking with the old man, how they were laughing… </h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%">Emily shifted her gaze to the cocoa. Emily was alone at this…and at last Christmas. She was alone for a lot of years. Yes, she really enjoys sitting here, drink cocoa and watching other peoples’ lives, she does it every year. But sometimes Emily realized that she hasn’t her own interesting store, that someone can watch. She always was, and forever will be alone.</h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%">-Hey, my friend called me, and he invite me to the party, maybe you want to go with me? – Mark was really nerves.</h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%">-Oh, I’d like to! – Emily smiled.</h3>
	<h3 style="margin-left: 3%">Mark heard some noise, he turned around, but everything was okey. He turn back to Emily, but nobody was there.</h3>
